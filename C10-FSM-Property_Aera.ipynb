A typical cases are the cross-section area of beams under bending, of bars under torsion, and torsion.

This means that we can cut the region into small piece $dA$ and then sum all these pieces up leading to the area measure $A$. If a sheet of material is uniform in thickness and density, it measures the amount of material. Therefore, area of an area is the physical property of the area. It does not depend on the coordinate system. Any coordinate system can be used to evaluate the area, and we often choose the one that is easy to work with. \n",

    "\n",
    "We have seen the Polar moment of area, $J$, in Chapter 9 when study bars subjected to torsion. It is the stiffness of the bar from the shape and size of the cross-sectional area. We have derived the formula for compute its value for a circular cross-sectional area: $J_z=\\frac{\\pi R^4}{2}$, where $R$ is the radius of the cross-section. We now present a general approach for computing $J_z$ for other shapes of areas, using the second moment of areas $I_{xx}$ and $I_{yy}$, and the perpendicular axis theorem. \n",

    "\\begin{equation} \\label{eqJI}\n",

    "Because we know how to compute $I_{xx}$ and $I_{yy}$ for a given area. This theorem gives a straight forward method to compute $J_z$ for the same area. On the other hand, if we know $J_z$ it can also help to obtain $I_{xx}$ and $I_{yy}$. "

    "### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "This section studies properties of areas, related to mechanics of materials. Area is the most basic property and used in all mechanics problems. The first and second moments of area are particularly useful in beam members. The polar moment of area is essential for bars subjected to torsion. \n",
    "\n",
    "For irregular shape of areas, we do not usually have closed-form formulas for their properties. Because all these properties can be computed vai integration, one can always compute these via numerical integration without much difficulty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For standard beams that produced in the industry, the cross-sections may not be regular. Often these properties are provided by the manufactures or standardized database. Designers can directly make use of those. \n",
    "\n",
    "Except area, all these properties change when the coordinates transforms. The formulas are essentially the same as we do for vectors (first order tensor) and stress tensor (2nd order tensor). The rule for transformation has been provided together with codes. "
