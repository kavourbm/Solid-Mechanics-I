    "Consider a uniform bar with cross-section area of $A$, and length $l$ made of linear elastic material. It is subjected to a distributed body-force $b_f$, as shown in Fig.\\ref{image:bar1Dbf}. It is fixed at the left-end, meaning that at $x=0, u=0$. At $x=l$, it may also be subjected to a concentrated force $f$. The problem can be treated as one-dimensional (1D), meaning that our concern is mainly the unknown displacement, stress, and strain varying with the coordinate $x$. \n",
