    abstract = "{A substantial fraction of the mysteries associated with crack extension might be eliminated if the description of fracture experiments could include some reasonable estimate of the stress conditions near the leading edge of a crack particularly at points of onset of rapid fracture and at points of fracture arrest. It is pointed out that for somewhat brittle tensile fractures in situations such that a generalized plane-stress or a plane-strain analysis is appropriate, the influence of the test configuration, loads, and crack length upon the stresses near an end of the crack may be expressed in terms of two parameters. One of these is an adjustable uniform stress parallel to the direction of a crack extension. It is shown that the other parameter, called the stress-intensity factor, is proportional to the square root of the force tending to cause crack extension. Both factors have a clear interpretation and field of usefulness in investigations of brittle-fracture mechanics.}",

    abstract = "{The task is undertaken of determining the bearing pressures, and the stresses and deformations created by them, in some cases that differ from those considered by Hertz in his classical study of contact. Thus two solids are examined which, before loading, are in contact along a row of evenly spaced lines in a horizontal plane, as indicated in Fig. 1(a). Between these lines the surfaces have a separation defined by a nearly flat cosine wave. A uniform pressure on top of the upper solid creates contact over an area consisting of a row of strips, reduces the separation of the solids between the strips, as suggested in Fig. 1(b), and creates contact pressures distributed as indicated in Fig. 1(c), with vertical rises in the diagram of pressure at the edges of the strips. At a greater load the width of the strip becomes equal to the wave length, and the contact is complete. At still greater loads the stresses increase as if the two solids were one. The procedure by which this problem is solved is demonstrated first by showing its easy application to some well-known cases, especially Hertz’s problem of circular cylinders in contact.Further applications are to a noncircular cylinder resting on a solid with a flat top, with an initial separation of the surfaces varying as the fourth power of the distance from the initial line of contact; to partial contact of two surfaces which are initially plane, except that one of them has a ridge or several parallel ridges; and to some related problems in which two parts of the same body are partially separated by the forming of one or more cracks.}",

abstract = {A new technique is presented to modify the hybrid numerical method (HNM) proposed earlier by the authors for analyzing the responses of anisotropic laminated plates subjected to time-step and time-pulse line loads. In the modified HNM, eigenfrequencies and modal factor functions for wave modes in the plate are computed at equally spaced points on the wavenumber axis. In each interval of the points, the eigenfrequencies and modal factor functions are replaced by straight lines, and the inverse Fourier integrations are then carried out analytically. The proposed modification can significantly reduce the sampling points in the inverse integrations. The modified HNM is much more efficient than the original HNM, and can be used to compute not only near-field and short-time but also far-field and long-time responses for anisotropic laminated plates, without increasing the sampling points. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the modified HNM.}
