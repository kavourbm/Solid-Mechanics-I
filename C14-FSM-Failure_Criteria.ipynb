    "The major purpose of stress analysis is to assess whether the stressed material will fail. Such an assessment is called failure analysis. The most important stage in material failure process is the yielding, which can often be clearly observed during experiments of many types of materials. When the stressed material gets to the yielding point, it starts deform drastically without much increase of loading, and the load level is often very close to the ultimate failure load. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, in many conservative design of structure, material yielding is regarded as failure. Such yielding-based designs apply to all structures and devices that are subjected to multiple repetitive uses, and often with large safety factors, meaning that the service stress should be far below the yield stress. Therefore, the yield criterion of a material is particularly important. Thus, this chapter focuses on various types yield criteria used for different types of materials.  It is written in **reference** \\cite{boresi2002advanced, gere1999mechanics, Timoshenko1970}.     "

    "### Basic concept\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in previous chapters, a structural components can undergo a stress state with multiple (as much as six) stress components at a point in the material. When a yielding criterion is defined, it is thus convenient to define a single equivalent or effective stress $σ_e$ that is a combination of all the stress components. Because material yielding/failing is a physical property of the material, and it should not depend on the coordinates used to compute the stresses, thus the effective stress should be a proper combination of the principal stresses or other stress invariants.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, different forms of yield criteria are needed for different types of materials.  We define a yield function $f(σ_{ij}, σ_{Y})$, where $σ_{ij}$ represent the stress state and $σ_{Y}$ is the yield strength of the material in uniaxial tension (or compression) obtained from an experiment. A stress-based yield criterion can be expressed as \\cite{lubliner1990plasticity}: \n",

Its Young's modulus is $E=200 GPa$, and Poisson's ratio is $\\nu = 0.3$.

    "### Remarks \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of failure criteria have been introduced in this chapter with detail formulations and Python codes. The choice of the criteria shall depend on the material. Therefore, experience on materials to be used, and databases of material properties for different types of materials are of importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The author was involved in one project that uses a newly designed composite material. We did not have sufficient data on the material, and decided to write a code to assess the safety using a number of criteria together, to ensure its safety for possible scenarios we can think of.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large class of materials called hyper-elastic materials, such as rubbers widely used in industry and soft issues involving all biological systems. For these types of materials, the analyses are more on the large geometrical deformation, and yielding is not usually a concern. This is an important and currently active area of study. Examples of study on this types of materials in the authors group can be found in \\cite{liusmoothed, liu2002mesh, wu2020selective, wu2020selective2, wu2022n, li2022novel}. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the structure is designed for single time use, we may stretch to use the full capacity of the material and allow the material gets beyond the yield point, into plastic deformation, until fracture. This involves plasticity analyses. It requires yield criterion together with 1) a proper flow rule governing the plastic strain and stress evolution after yielding, and 2) a hardening rule that predicts changes in the yield surface. Examples for such analysis can be found in textbooks. Some study on this types of materials in the authors group can be found in \\cite{zeng2015smoothing, cui2009elasto, zeng2016smoothing}. Interested readers may pursue this topic starting from the wikipage on [flow_plasticity_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_plasticity_theory), and the references therein.  "
