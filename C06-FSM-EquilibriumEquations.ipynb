    "Consider a three-dimensional (3D) solid material occupying a physical domain $Ω$ bounded by $Γ$. The solid is subjected to body forces $\\mathbf{b}$ over $Ω$. The displacements of parts of the boundary $Γ_u$ is strained, rest of boundary $Γ_t$ is subjected traction forces $\\mathbf{t}$ that are given or zero, and $Γ=Γ_u ∪ Γ_t$, as shown in Fig.\\ref{image:3Dsolid}. \n",

    "In the previous chapters, we discussed where the stresses are coming from, how strains relate to displacements, and then how the stress and strain are related. We need now one more important piece: how the stress and forces are working together to satisfy the equilibrium conditions. This chapter provides this piece. The conclusion is: the divergence of the stresses at any point in solid material is compensated by the body force distributed in the solid, leading to the **equilibrium equation**. It governs the behavior of the loaded solid material inside its domain, and hence known as the **governing equations** for loaded solid materials.  "

In actual engineering problems of mechanics of solid materials, there are always some kind of conditions given on the boundary of the domain. These boundary conditions (BCs) must also be satisfied.

    "### On techniques for soling solid mechanics problems\n",

    "To find a solution to a solid mechanics problem, we need to solve **a system of equations**, consisting the governing equation and the boundary conditions Eqs.(\\ref{equibc}) and/or (\\ref{eqsijbc}), and the compatibility equations derived in Chapter 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the governing equation can be written in stress given in Eq.(\\ref{eqEeqij}), and in terms of displacements Eq.(\\ref{eqCeqij7}), we have largely two possible methods to solve these system equations: stress method and displacement method. These methods are useful for higher dimensional problems (2D and 3D). Each method has its own strategy, tricks and strength in solving different types of problems. We will discuss these methods in future volumes in this book series. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, our objective is to solve problems for structural members, and the problem can often be reduced to 1D. In these cases, stress method and displacement is essentially the same. We will use displacement method in the later chapters for various types of problems, because it more straightforward and easy to code for systematical solutions for various types of problems, including indeterminate ones.

    "### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This chapter presents a set of system equations for solid mechanics problems. Using a free-body-diagram from a stressed 3D solid, we established a set of equilibrium equations in all directions. It is a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) with the stress components as the unknowns. Thus, there are 6 unknowns. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because the stress tensor a function of coordinates, we thus also use the divergence of the stress tensor function together with the body-force vector to derive the same set of equilibrium equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. These PDEs are then converted into ones with displacements as the unknowns. This reduces the unknowns to 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. These sets of PDEs are then reduced to those for 2D ones and 1D ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Both displacement and traction boundary conditions are introduced. These BCs need to be satisfied in addition to the set of equilibrium PDEs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Various solution method will be introduced in future volumes on how to solve these sets of system equations for 2D and 3D solid mechanics problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following chapters of this book will be focusing on problems in mechanics of materials, which can often be simplified as 1D problems, or easy solvable 2D problems. Hence, efficient solvers can be devised for various types of practical problems for solid materials. Techniques on how to derived the simplified systems of equations will be discussed in great detail, followed by solution procedures and Python codes.  "
