    "\n",
    "The Editor-in-Chief of this books series, Dr. GR Liu has been working in areas related to Computational Methods over 40+ years. He developed his first FEM codes for nonlinear problems in 1980, and published more than 600 journal papers and 12 monographs in this area since then. After all these years of studying, using and developing computational methods, he started to think about a means to help others interested individual to learn computational methods in a more effective, systematic, and more smoother way. He has concluded that developing this book series is the best way to achieve this objective.  "

    "Materials are used to build devices and structures for various purposed, and used in our everyday life. This book introduces the subject of **Mechanics of Materials**, which is the most basic and essential for safe and effective use of materials in fields of sciences and engineering.  When a device (or structure) is loaded, the members in it experience forces, stressed, strained, and undergoes deformation. If the device is not designed properly, it may either fail to carry the desired load or to heavy with material not fully utilized. The subject studies the **relationships** between these **forces, stresses, strains, and deformation** at **basic structural members of materials** is called Mechanics of Materials. \n",
    "\n",
    "This book covers the **fundamental principles** of mechanics of materials, focusing on the mechanical behavior of structural members under various types of loads, including **axial loading, bending, shearing, and torsion**. The members can have various shape can constrained in different ways. Concepts of **energy** and **failure criteria** will also be studied.  \n",

    "The principles of mechanics of materials are explained in detail, formulated, and demonstrated with **numerous examples** and illustrations. **Python** is used both formulation derivation, finding solution symbolically or numerically, and plot the results in graphics. \n",

    "Proper connection between theory and **real-world engineering problems** will be made through these examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The materials of this book can be digested thorough different forms of **learning process**, including classroom teaching, on-line courses, and also self-study.  Because Python codes are provided, readers can easily see how the theory is formulated and how the solutions are obtained in terms of formulas, numerical number, and graphs.  Readers may also deepen the understanding via playing with codes, and even further develop **his/her own codes** for solving other related problems.  \n",
